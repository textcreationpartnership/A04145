            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Towne is in a Valley, vnder the mountaine <hi>Chrouena,</hi> in neare neighbourhood, and not aboue the diÅ¿tance of two leagues from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Millaine:</hi> and of like neareneÅ¿Å¿e to the Porte of <hi>Tuentes;</hi> Å¿tanding vpon the banke of the Lake of <hi>Como,</hi> where paÅ¿Å¿eth the Riuer of <hi>Mora:</hi> which Riuer, although it carrie a Å¿trong and violent current, yet can it not, in anie reaÅ¿on, be preÅ¿umed to haue beene the cauÅ¿e of this ruine vvhereof vvee are to Å¿peake. Nature had fortified this Towne, and immured it, as it were, betwixt two mountains: the one whereof was Å¿ingularlie fertile in Winter, and other Fruites of the Earth making her appeare with another cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tenance, than of an hideous Rock: which could promiÅ¿e no pleaÅ¿ure nor delight, but of Å¿uch an Hill as Å¿upplyed the Inhabitantes with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite commodities, vnder-ground Caues, &amp; Gardens,
<pb facs="tcp:1461:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->Store-houÅ¿es; and other commodious places, which they found within the boÅ¿ome of this mountaine, with all Å¿orts of pleaÅ¿ures, delightes, and delicates. This other Hill, which is aboue <hi>Silano,</hi> and beyond the Riuer, is Å¿omewhat more diÅ¿tant from the Town, which, it Å¿eemeth, Nature had purpoÅ¿ely remooued from the Å¿ame, leÅ¿t it might (perhaps) too much Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and obÅ¿cure it, that the great multitude of trees wherewith this Hill was repleniÅ¿hed, being of it Å¿elfe higher and Å¿teeper than the former, and yet bearing (notwithÅ¿tanding the Å¿teepeneÅ¿Å¿e) both hay and wood, for the Å¿upply of this Towne. CloÅ¿e to this mountaine there Å¿tood another, much higher than the Å¿ame, and wholly barrend and deÅ¿arted: a fatall Hill, and deÅ¿tined to the ruine of this miÅ¿erable Towne, and all her inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The fourth day of this inÅ¿tant month of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, this great and Å¿teepe Hill was Å¿haken, either by Å¿ome windes vnder the ground, or by Å¿ome Å¿ecret tempeÅ¿t which Nature raiÅ¿ed from within her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels: in Å¿uch fort, as about Å¿ix a clock in the euening, that which Å¿eemed to be vnmoueable, was Å¿eene in a Å¿hort Å¿pace to be pulled vp by the roots, and borne away by the fury of the windes. A Å¿trange caÅ¿e, there neuer hauing beene Å¿eene Å¿o great and fearfull an Earth-quake. This mountaine then being Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his fury, fell with Å¿uch violence vpon that vnhappy Towne, as it buried both it, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants together. It was about Supper-time, at
<pb facs="tcp:1461:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->what time the moÅ¿t parte of the Townesmen were Å¿et at Table, when they found themÅ¿elues ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with theÅ¿e Å¿o mightie ruines, vnder which, at an inÅ¿tant they gaue vppe the ghoÅ¿t. Scarcelie was any man exempted, for of three thouÅ¿and &amp; Å¿ix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth perÅ¿ons, which at that time were reckoned to bee in the Towne, there eÅ¿caped onelie foure, of whome wee will Å¿peake more particularlie heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The loÅ¿Å¿e of goods was exceeding great, inaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the eÅ¿teemate thereof paÅ¿Å¿eth three Millions of Golde. The rage and tempeÅ¿tuous force of the windes was Å¿o outragious, as they that were in the fieldes felt themÅ¿elues thereby transported into pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whollie vnknowne. The Lord <hi>Laurence Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolera</hi> reporteth, that being in a Garden of his, with his Niece, hee was borne by the violence of that tempeÅ¿t aboue and beyonde the Riuer: and hee was found on a little Hill, called <hi>Ronco,</hi> hauing a Napkin at his Shoulder, and his Legges broken off. In the Å¿ame place were likewiÅ¿e founde the little Belles of Sainct <hi>Maries</hi> Kirke, borne by the like violence out of the Steeple to that place, being halfe a league from the Å¿aide Kirke. To conclude, this boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing was Å¿o terrible, and the bruit Å¿pread Å¿o farre, that all the neighbouring Countreyes preÅ¿ently took the cry, and Å¿tood affrighted with the horror thereof.</p>
            <p>The people comming a little to themÅ¿elues, ran to beholde this Å¿pectacle, vvhere in Å¿tead of finding a Towne, in the Valleye before mentioned, they
<pb facs="tcp:1461:7"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->found an high and fearfull mountaine, hauing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its entralls Å¿wallowed the whole company of its poore inhabitants: no man eÅ¿caping, Å¿aue only four, as were Å¿aide, whom wee will name in particular, to giue more aÅ¿Å¿urance to the trueth of the fact.</p>
            <p>A Mother there deÅ¿irous to Å¿aue her Childe, loÅ¿t her legges, yet could not recouer him whome Å¿hee held deareÅ¿t in the worlde. A young man, called <hi>Francis Torno,</hi> who was gone down into one of the Vaults vnder ground (which before we mentioned, and deÅ¿cribed in the firÅ¿t Mountaine) to draw wine. Another young fellow, who a little before was gone to a Vineyarde, on the Å¿ame mountaine, to gather Peaches. And the fourth was the Lord <hi>Scandolera,</hi> of whom we before recounted that miraculous Å¿tory.</p>
            <p>The Riuer <hi>Mora,</hi> which watered all this Valley, hath thereby loÅ¿t its naturall and ordinary current: and hath beene enforced to recouer its courÅ¿e more than a league from the place. This is the Å¿umme of what happened in the places afore Å¿aid, being in trueth a wonder vnmatchable in any Age.</p>
            <p>The Deeps below, and Fire aboue, hold Å¿ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power of Nature: but to Å¿ee mountains remoue, and change their places, wee muÅ¿t in trueth auouch, that this thing is Å¿o high, and the cauÅ¿es Å¿o hidden, as humane wit cannot pierce into the depth of theÅ¿e profound myÅ¿teries. To make Nature Å¿o
<pb facs="tcp:1461:7"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->potent, as to giue occaÅ¿ion for the vvorld to thinke, that this accident proceeded from the force of the winds, which perhaps were Å¿hut vp within the womb of the Earth, and there had intermixed with Å¿ome encloÅ¿ed fire, which hauing vndermined this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, did in Å¿uch Å¿ort ouerturne it, were to attribute vnto Nature too much force and Å¿trength. To call to remembrance another <hi>Sodome,</hi> wherof this is the image, the colours only excepted, I meane the forme of their deÅ¿truction: to aÅ¿cribe this calamitie to the judgement of God, were to partake with the Å¿ecrets of the HigheÅ¿t, and as companions to his Throne, to giue Å¿entence againÅ¿t his people. Therefore, Å¿uÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our judgements, let vs humble our Å¿elues before God, leÅ¿t the like thing happen vnto vs.</p>
